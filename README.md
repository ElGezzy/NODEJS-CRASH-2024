# Node.js Crash Course 2024

A simple Node.js project following Brad Traversy's crash course.

## Features

- Basic Node.js setup
- Example scripts and modules

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-crash-2024.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to store environment variables (such as `PORT`).
Example:

```
PORT=8000
```

The `.env` file is ignored by git (see `.gitignore`), so you should create it manually.
